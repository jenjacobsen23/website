Most teams don't ship broken apps because they missed a feature.
They ship broken apps because the basics weren't ready.

This checklist captures the minimum bar for production readiness in an Expo app — especially when Firebase and EAS are involved. It's intentionally boring, because boring is what scales.

If you run this list before every release, you'll avoid the majority of expensive post-launch issues.

## 1. Environment separation

Production starts with clarity.

**Checklist**

- Dev, staging, and prod each use a separate backend
- `.env.development`, `.env.staging`, `.env.production` exist and are complete
- No fallback env values — builds fail if required vars are missing
- EAS build profiles explicitly map to environments
- Active environment is visible in the app (log or UI)

**Why it matters**

If you can't tell which backend a build is using, you're not in control of the release.

## 2. Error monitoring & observability

You cannot fix what you cannot see.

**Checklist**

- Error monitoring is enabled in all environments
- Environment tag is attached to every event
- A test error is sent and visible before release
- Performance monitoring is enabled (if used)

**Why it matters**

App Store reviews are not a monitoring strategy.

## 3. Build & release safety

Your build system should be more stable than your app.

**Checklist**

- One EAS build profile per environment
- Bundle identifiers / app IDs are correct
- OTA channels are isolated per environment
- OTA updates tested in staging before production
- Native version and OTA compatibility verified

**Why it matters**

Most "mystery bugs" are build pipeline mistakes.

## 4. Secrets & security

Assume anything on a device is public.

**Checklist**

- Client-safe values use `EXPO_PUBLIC_*`
- Secrets live in EAS or backend infrastructure
- No credentials committed to git history
- Firebase rules match the environment
- API keys are scoped and restricted

**Why it matters**

Security failures are almost always configuration failures.

## 5. Integration verification

Never trust configuration without proof.

**Checklist**

- Firebase initializes successfully in the release build
- Firestore reads/writes work in the target environment
- Push notifications deliver (if used)
- Permissions behave correctly on iOS and Android
- A fresh install works (no cached state assumptions)

**Why it matters**

Most production bugs are integration failures, not logic errors.

## 6. CI/CD hygiene

Shipping should be boring.

**Checklist**

- Builds are reproducible
- CI validates env configuration
- Secrets are not stored in the repo
- Build logs clearly show the active environment

**Why it matters**

Manual build steps don't scale past one developer.

## 7. Final pre-release sanity check

Run this before every release:

- Which environment is this build running?
- Which backend is it connected to?
- Where do errors go?
- How would I know if this broke for users?

If you can't answer all four instantly, stop the release.

## Production readiness is mostly clarity

"Production-ready" is not about architecture diagrams or microservices.
It's about knowing, with certainty:

- what environment you're running
- what backend you're using
- how failures are observed
- how builds are produced

Everything else is secondary.

## Want this implemented, not just written?

All of the above is already wired into my production-ready Expo starter:

- Multi-environment configuration
- Firebase initialization with validation
- Sentry error monitoring
- EAS build profiles
- OTA channel isolation
- A simple UI to verify integrations
